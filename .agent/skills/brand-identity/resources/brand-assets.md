# Brand Assets & Logo Hierarchy

This project is a collaboration between three distinct brands. Use the correct logo and positioning for each entity based on the context.

## 1. Tech Alley Henderson (The Event)
**Role:** The Main Event / Project Identity.
**Usage:** Use this logo for the primary application header, main branding, and event-specific context.
**Asset Path:**
- `docs/Branding - Tech Alley Henderson (Innovation Henderson Hub) /TechAlleyHenderson_Logo.png`

## 2. Social Alignment (The Architect)
**Role:** Creative Architect. The entity *behind* the experience.
**Usage:** Prominent attribution (e.g., "Powered by Social Alignment", Splash screens, Footers). This brand should feel like the "producer" or "engine" of the app.
**Asset Paths:**
- `docs/Branding - Tech Alley Henderson (Innovation Henderson Hub) /Untitled design.png`
- `docs/Branding - Tech Alley Henderson (Innovation Henderson Hub) /Untitled design (1).png`
- `docs/Branding - Tech Alley Henderson (Innovation Henderson Hub) /Untitled design (2).png`

## 3. Dead Sprint Radio / Hello Henderson (The Guest)
**Role:** Featured Guest / Media Partner.
**Usage:** Use only for specific segments related to "Hello Henderson" media or "Dead Sprint Radio". Less prominent than the other two.
**Asset Path:**
- `docs/Branding - Tech Alley Henderson (Innovation Henderson Hub) /DeadSprint_Logo.png`

## Positioning Rules
- **Hierarchy:** Social Alignment (Producer) > Tech Alley (Event) > Dead Sprint (Guest).
- **Styling:** Ensure these logos are placed on **Dark backgrounds** (Slate-900+) to match the project's Cyber/Neon aesthetic.
